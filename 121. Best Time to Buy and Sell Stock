121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104



class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // minimum price seen so far
        int maxProfit = 0;                 // maximum profit

        for (int price : prices) {
            // Update minPrice if current price is lower
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price;
            } 
            // Calculate profit if sold today and update maxProfit
            else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = price - minPrice;
            }
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        int[] prices1 = {7,1,5,3,6,4};
        System.out.println(sol.maxProfit(prices1)); // Output: 5

        int[] prices2 = {7,6,4,3,1};
        System.out.println(sol.maxProfit(prices2)); // Output: 0
    }
}
